		<h1>Eclipse</h1>
		<p><br/>Formal work on textile tension upstream of the project.
Choice of the same system for all experiments. Each is composed of a cardboard cylinder covered with a fabric (here polyester jersey). The fabric is then pulled down to create a hollow. <br/> <br/> Based on previous research and the theme of the refuge, I chose to design an object to protect myself from the sun.
For this I reversed the direction of my experiments, the fabric is now pulled upwards to design a parasol. Thus, the typical shape of parasols is created by the textile tension.
It also helps to purify the shape by avoiding the use of many articulated metal arms.<br/></p>

		<p1>This parasol is composed of an aluminum pole on which is hung a pole of 1.60m in diameter covered with a cotton and polyester fabric. The hoop is lifted by a rope hanging from the center of the fabric (to make a cone when stretched) and passing through the top of the mast, which is 2m50. The rope is finally retained by a cleat on the mast.</p1>
